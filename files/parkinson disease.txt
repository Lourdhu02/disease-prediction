Parkinson's disease is a complex neurological condition that affects the brain's ability to control movement. It is characterized by a gradual onset of symptoms, including tremors, stiffness, slowness of movement, and impaired balance and coordination. These symptoms result from the degeneration of dopamine-producing neurons in a region of the brain called the substantia nigra.

The exact cause of Parkinson's disease is not fully understood, but both genetic and environmental factors are believed to contribute to its development. Age is the most significant risk factor, with the majority of individuals being diagnosed after the age of 60.

In addition to motor symptoms, Parkinson's disease can also cause non-motor symptoms such as cognitive changes, mood disorders, sleep disturbances, and autonomic dysfunction. These non-motor symptoms can significantly impact a person's quality of life and may precede the onset of motor symptoms in some cases.

Diagnosis of Parkinson's disease is based on clinical evaluation, medical history, and assessment of symptoms. While there is currently no cure for Parkinson's disease, treatment aims to manage symptoms and improve quality of life. Medications, physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy are commonly used to help individuals with Parkinson's disease maintain mobility and independence for as long as possible.

Living with Parkinson's disease requires ongoing management and support from healthcare professionals, family members, and caregivers. Research into the causes and treatments of Parkinson's disease continues to advance our understanding of the condition and improve outcomes for those affected by it.
